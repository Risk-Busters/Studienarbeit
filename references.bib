  abstract = {The question whether risk management contributes to IT project success is considered relevant by people from both academic and practitioners’ communities already for a long time. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the empirical evidence that either supports or opposes the claim that risk management contributes to IT project success. In addition, this paper also investigates the validity of the assumptions on which risk management is based. The analysis leads to remarkable conclusions. Over the last 10 years, much has become known about what causes IT projects to fail. However, there is still very little empirical evidence that this knowledge is actually used in projects for managing risks in IT projects. This paper concludes with indicating new directions for research in the relation between risk management and project success. Key elements are stakeholder perception of risk and success and stakeholder behaviour in the risk management process.},

In the case of challenged projects, where failure factors are overcome the projects go on to be delivered successfully. Hence, it is worthwhile to explore the key factors that determine failure, since this information may be useful in averting future project failures. This research aims to collate and classify existing research in order to: (1) understand the common failure factors; and (2) categorise identified factors pertaining to country, project stage and failure categories. In so doing, this research work goes beyond the identification of traditional factors since it further classifies them according to project stages, failure types and geographical regions. This research contributes to knowledge by identifying and synthesising existing understanding of the failure of IS/IT projects.},

A Panel session was held at the IFIP Working Group 8.6 conference in Bangalore in 2013 which forms the subject of this Special Issue. Its aim was to reflect on the need for new perspectives and research directions, to provide insights and further guidance for managers on factors enabling IS success and avoiding IS failure. Several key issues emerged, such as the need to study problems from multiple perspectives, to move beyond narrow considerations of the IT artifact, and to venture into underexplored organizational contexts, such as the public sector.},

Learn exactly how to create an Angular Progressive Web App (PWA) from scratch, how you can use different tools to audit and improve it, and leverage Angular CLI or Workbox to turn your app into a PWA. Using browser APIs – including the Credential Management, Payment Request, Geolocation, Web Bluetooth, WebUSB and Generic Sensors APIs – you can unleash the potential of PWAs and build applications that enhance user experience. Angulars game-changing built-in features, including the Angular service worker module, can be leveraged to construct responsive and reliable PWAs that can look and feel just like native mobile apps. You'll learn how to boost your app speed, how to increase user engagement using push notifications, and how to implement offline storage and different caching APIs in Angular. You'll even see how to convert an existing Angular app into a PWA. Whether youre new to building PWAs, or want to learn how to use Angular to improve your app development, Progressive Web Apps with Angular provides the know-how to build and deploy an Angular PWA.},

The paper examines the state of current research on the topic and points out gaps in existing literature. The review indicates that gamification provides positive effects, however, the effects are greatly dependent on the context in which the gamification is being implemented, as well as on the users using it. The findings of the review provide insight for further studies as well as for the design of gamified systems.},

Sie benötigen keine besonderen Vorkenntnisse – lediglich Grundkenntnisse der JavaScript-Syntax – und können sofort loslegen. Haben Sie einmal verstanden, wie React funktioniert, werden Sie eine maßgeschneiderte eigene App bauen, mit der Anwender Weine bewerten und ergänzende Notizen erfassen können. Sie verstehen dann schnell, warum so viele Entwickler React als Schlüsseltechnologie der modernen Webentwicklung sehen. - Richten Sie React ein und schreiben Sie Ihre erste "Hallo Welt"-Web-App. - Erstellen und verwenden Sie eigene React-Komponenten, die aus generischen DOM-Komponenten aufgebaut sind. - Bauen Sie eine Komponente für eine Datentabelle, mit der Sie deren Inhalt bearbeiten, sortieren, durchsuchen und exportieren können. - Verwenden Sie die Syntaxerweiterung JSX als Alternative zu Funktionsaufrufen. - Richten Sie einen übersichtlichen, einfachen Build-Prozess ein, der Ihnen hilft, das Augenmerk auf React zu legen. - Erstellen Sie eine vollständige Anwendung, mit der Sie Daten auf dem Client speichern können. - Setzen Sie ESLint, Flow und Jest ein, um den Code Ihrer komplexer werdenden Anwendung zu testen. - Organisieren Sie mit Flux die Kommunikation zwischen Komponenten.},

  abstract = {Increased demand for better technology and perpetual global expansion continue to provide developers with many project opportunities for success, as well as failure. While no industry is immune from project failure, the Information Technology (IT) industry is shown to be more susceptible to risk and failure than those of other industries. Agile project management, which facilitates adaptation to changing circumstances and alleviates rigid formal controls, has become more popular in the software development industry though is not entirely compatible with traditional project management approaches. In this paper we will examine the primary causes of IT project management failure stated in modern literature, analyze these causes, and discuss the degree of complexity within the projects from a systemic perspective related to emergence, non- monotonicity, and non-ergodicity. The paper concludes with some conceptual management approaches that respond to these â€œtrueâ€ root causes of failure, for applications in agile organizations and beyond.},
