\subsubsection{Use Case Specification: \ac{UC}6 Risk Discussion}
\label{sec:domainBbg}
\paragraph*{Description}\mbox{}\\
The process of adding risks to a project is based on three steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\vspace{-3mm}
	\setlength\itemsep{-1em}
	
	\item A project member proposes a risk (name and description). (UC3, chapter \ref{sec:domainBbd}).
	\item A specified number of project members review the proposed risk. After the review process the risk is ready for discussion.
	\item The whole project team discusses and defines:
	\begin{itemize}
		\vspace{-3mm}
		\setlength\itemsep{-1em}	
		\item probability of occurrence
		\item impact
		\item response(s)
		\item person in charge
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{Basic Flow} \mbox{}\\

\end{wrapfigure}

\begin{enumerate}
	\vspace{-3mm}
	\setlength\itemsep{-1em}
	
	\item A project member proposes a risk (name and description as defined in UC3 Risk CRUD chapter \ref{sec:domainBbd})
	\begin{itemize}
		\vspace{-3mm}
		\setlength\itemsep{-1em}
		
		\item The proposed risk is visible in the section proposed risks at the project detail page ("Proposed risks").
		\item All members of the project receive a notification (in their activity stream) about the new proposed risk and the request to review it.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item A specified number of project members review the proposed risk. After the review process the risk is ready for discussion.
	\begin{itemize}
		\vspace{-3mm}
		\setlength\itemsep{-1em}
		
		\item When the specified number of project members have positively reviewed the risk, it is visible in the section ("Risks open to discussion").
		\item The risk is automatically ready for discussion (not recommended). The recommended way is to wait until a specified number of risks open for estimation are collected. Then an estimation session for all risks can be started started.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item The risk is estimated by the whole project team:
	\begin{itemize}
		\vspace{-3mm}
		\setlength\itemsep{-1em}
		
		\item All project members receive a notification (in their activity stream) to estimate the risk in terms of (probability of occurrence, impact) and to add response(s). Probability of occurrence and impact are mandatory fields, response(s) are optional.
		\item The risk's color coding is determined by the probability of occurrence and the impact.
		\item It is checked if at least one response is defined. If not, the project members are notified to add a response.
		\item In the last step the person in charge is defined. Therefore, a notification where the user is able to sign up for being responsible for the risk is sent to all project members.  
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Finally, the risk appears in the project risk tab ("Project risks").
\end{enumerate}


\paragraph*{Alternative Flows}\mbox{}\\

\noindent
Proposed risk receives negative reviews:
\begin{itemize}
	\vspace{-3mm}
	\setlength\itemsep{-1em}
	
	\item A project member negatively reviews a risk.
	\item The reviewing person adds feedback for the risk which is sent to the risk owner.
	\item The proposed risk can be edited or deleted.
	\item When the risk is deleted it is removed from the section proposed risks.
	\item When the risk is edited the review process data is removed and the message for reviewing is sent again.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Project members don't react to their notifications to...
\begin{enumerate}
	\vspace{-3mm}
	\setlength\itemsep{-1em}
	
	\item ... review a risk: When the needed amount of reviews is not achieved the notification is sent again.
	\item ... estimate a risk: When the needed amount of estimations is not achieved the notification is sent again.
	\item ... define a person in charge: When no person volunteers the notification is sent again. For finding a risk person in charge fast the Gamification concept Challenge is used.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{Special Requirements and Preconditions}\mbox{}\\
The preconditions for this use case are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\vspace{-3mm}
	\setlength\itemsep{-1em}	
	\item  A project exists.
	\item The user is member of the project.
	\item A user has proposed a risk.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{Postconditions and Persistence}\mbox{}\\
The postconditions for this use case are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\vspace{-3mm}
	\setlength\itemsep{-1em}	
	\item The proposed risk was reviewed and estimated. 
	\item The risk contains all relevant data.
	\item The risk is visible as part of the projects risk tab.
\end{enumerate}
