\section{Gamification}
\label{sec:domainC}

\spacing{1.5}

The gamification conception is based on the gamification design process described in \ref{sec:theoryBd}. Therefore, the following chapters deal with the player (\ref{sec:domainCa}), the mission (\ref{sec:domainCb}), the mechanics (\ref{sec:domainCc}) and the evaluation (\ref{sec:domainCd}).

\subsection{Player Personas}
\label{sec:domainCa}
By consultiong the survey (\ref{sec:DomainA}) the application's target group was figured out . Based on this player personas for the group of project managers and project members were created:

\paragraph*{Project Manager}

The following image \ref{fig:personaProjectManager} shows the key characteristics of the project manager persona.
Project managers experience a rather formal work culture, because of their position. They are a mixture of team players and independent leaders. That's why they combine competitive and cooperative behavior. Furthermore, they need to be structured in their work.
As project managers they are fully responsible for all parts of the project. They need to manage the project's time and cost planning, the roadmap with milestones, the handling of potential stakeholders and the interaction with the project team. To put it in a nutshell it can be stated, that project managers are responsible for lots of different project parts. Based on this variety lots of risks can potentially occur from the different domains (e.g. stakeholder claims, technical complexity, project management), which couldn't be treated only by the project managers. They need the collaboration of their project team to handle these risks successfully.

\paragraph*{Project Member}

The following image \ref{fig:personaProjectMember} shows the key characteristics of the project member persona.
Based on their position within the team, members tend to be rather cooperative than competitive. Their working culture is informal and the team is oriented towards reaching goals together. As developers they are not that much interested in project management and the project finishing in time. Their main attention is drawn by a personal gain of new knowledge and an involvement in interesting projects. If the projects finish in cost and time this is rather a addition and not the main goal. Nevertheless, in terms of project risk management they are the expert for all technical risks of the project.

\subsection{Mission}
\label{sec:domainCb}

By defining the mission, we aim to have a specific vision in mind, from which the following steps can be derived. The mission is defined according to \ref{sec:theoryBd}. 
As a first step the current situation was already considered in \ref{sec:theoryA}. The next step deals with the business outcome. As target business outcome we would like to lower the number of projects failing because of risk management not being adhered to. This should be achieved by the development of a gamified application for project risk management.
Our mission is to increase the user engagement and support habit building in terms of project risk management. Especially we want to support the project managers as good as possible in the desired phase of risk response management and monitoring (\ref{sec:DomainA}).

\subsection{Mechanics}
\label{sec:domainCc}

This chapter describes the conception whose mechanics apply motivational design patterns(\ref{sec:theoryBc}).
The following mechanics have been selected for the risk management domain by us and are described in detail:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Activity Stream and Notifications
	\item Growth, Specialization—Badge and Increased Responsibility
	\item Self-defined challenges
	\item Praise and Rewards (Score)
	\item Collaborative form of leaderboards
	\item Journey
	\item Social Feedback/Feedback loops
	\item Task Queue
	\item Additional minor patterns
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Activity Stream and Notifications}
The activity stream represents the home page and is a key component of the application. This way the user is notified about relevant changes. Furthermore the messages sent can motivate the user to directly jump into a specific workflow or task. 
It is part of the application wide engagement loop and especially accountable for the initial motivating emotion and the call to action.
%TODO ??? With notifications appearing 
%Push notifications
%-> abgewandelte form von operant conditioning mit variable ratio

The patterns used are the activity stream as social pattern and notifications as interface pattern.
The activity stream is implemented as part of \ac{UC}10 Activity Stream (\ref{sec:domainBbk}).

\paragraph*{Growth, Specialization—Badge and Increased Responsibility}

Depending on their level of interaction with the application users can be classified on the range between beginner and advanced. This can be mapped by the following five specialization—badges created by us:

project manager > risk buster > risk sage > risk master > risk owner > project member

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Project member: basic project member without any specific rights
	\item Risk owner: reached by owning a specific number of risks (being the person in charge).
	\item Risk master: reached by being part of a specific number of risk ranking processes.
	\item Risk sage: reached by reviewing and contributing a specific number of risks.
	\item Risk buster: reached by successfully contributing a specific number of risk responses.
	\item Project manager: highest achievable badge with right for creating new projects and managing existing projects.
\end{enumerate}

Growth is achieved in two areas. On the one hand specialization—badges and on the other hand the further development of project risks.

Increased responsibility is used for the process of creating and managing a project. There are two workflows how a project can be initialized. The first possibility is that a user who has reached the project manager specialization—badge creates the project. The second possibility is that at least two members vouch, that one person can be a project manager.

All three patterns (Growth, Specialization—Badge, Increased Responsibility) belong to the group of gameful patterns.
They are implemented as part of \ac{UC}1 User CRUD (\ref{sec:domainBbb}), \ac{UC}2 Team Access CRUD (\ref{sec:domainBbc}), \ac{UC}6 Risk Discussion (\ref{sec:domainBbg}), \ac{UC}8 Risk Response Management (\ref{sec:domainBbi}), \ac{UC}11 Progress Indicator (\ref{sec:domainBbl}).

\paragraph*{Self-defined challenges}

%TODO einbauen? -> falls ja noch Quelle suchen
%"If it doesn't challenge you it doesn't change you" - Fred Devito
Applied challenges have a positive impact while doing them and after completion. Over the course of a challenge the user is motivated to complete it. By completing challenges the users feel competent and their self-efficacy is increasing. A possible risk could be challenges that are too difficult and therefore demotivating. That is why we use the concept of self-defined challenges. By having users set the challenges themselves the probability of success is increased.

\noindent
Self-defined challenges appear at several locations in the risk management application:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Project initialization (e.g. project manager defines how many risks should be contributed in a self-defined time period)
	\item Risk Monitoring (e.g. daily, weekly or monthly question if preventive action was done with reminder as notification before. This tries to support habit building).
\end{itemize}

The challenges mechanic is part of the gameful patterns. 
Self-defined challenges are implemented as part of \ac{UC}7 Risk Monitoring (\ref{sec:domainBbh}) and \ac{UC}9 Project initialization (\ref{sec:domainBbj}).

\paragraph*{Praise and Rewards (Score)}

Users are rewarded with points for performing desired behavior. This adds extrinsic motivational factors to the application. These mechanics are needed as a basis for a collaborative form of leaderboards (next paragraph). The collaborative leaderboard provides the user with direct feedback as to why it is worthwhile to collect points. So praise and rewards in combination with collaborative leaderboards are working towards achieving a positive conditioning.

Points can be gained by performing desired behavior. Such as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item proposing risks
	\item reviewing risks
	\item being person in charge
	\item being an active part of the community (e.g. contribute and manage pool risks and pool risk responses)
\end{itemize}

Praise is an interface pattern and score a gameful pattern.
Praise and rewards are implemented as part of \ac{UC}5 Risk Pool (\ref{sec:domainBbf}), \ac{UC}6 Risk Discussion (\ref{sec:domainBbg}), \ac{UC}7 Risk Monitoring (\ref{sec:domainBbh}) and \ac{UC}8 Risk Response Management (\ref{sec:domainBbi}).

\paragraph*{Collaborative form of leaderboards}

As described above the users are rewarded for desired behavior. Hence the slope of the graph (points over time) is a user activity indicator. Furthermore her/his own activity graph is easily visible for the user through the user profile page.
Instead of comparing one individual against another individual based on the points score (classical form of leaderboards) we propose a team-based comparison concept. 
In detail following features are planned:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For each project team the \textbf{median of the activity score of all project members} is calculated. This results in an activity score for each project and enables the comparison of different projects. This is done through an anonymized leaderboard (e.g. "Your project activity is currently at position X of Y projects"). Furthermore, it is connected with concrete recommendations, how the position can be improved.
	%TODO: clarify if  geometrical or arithmetical mean or median
	\item The project can be classified based on the \textbf{sum of all points from each project member}. Based on this the project can be categorized as a "bronze", "silver" or "gold" project.
	%TODO: Concept how big teams and small teams are comparable with this approach
\end{itemize}

The important question cooperation vs. competition is already part of scientific research. Vegt et al. \cite{vegtDesigningGamificationGuide2015} have discovered, that based on the way gamification mechanics are applied either cooperative or competitive behavior is supported. Furthermore, the team collaboration can be enhanced.

By comparing whole projects and their teams the competitive character of leaderboards is moderated and complemented with cooperative elements. This strengthens the group spirit. Such cooperativeness can be observed in team sports. The fact of being a member of a team and being able to achieve something together develops new motivation.

Leaderboards are a gameful pattern. 
The collaborative leaderboard is implemented as part of \ac{UC}2 Team Access CRUD (\ref{sec:domainBbc}) and \ac{UC}9 Project initialization (\ref{sec:domainBbj}).

\paragraph*{Journey}

By individually supporting the user while using the application one can lower the probability of disappointed users. Based on the current phase of the user (beginner, medium, advanced) the application provides different assistance. The following list depicts the specific intended actions in detail:

\noindent
Beginner level:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduction to the application and its aims at the first application start.
	\item Explanation of the risk discussion process.
	\item Presentation of the risk pool concept.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Medium level:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Show path to mastery through specialization—badges and task queues.
	\item Visible feedback of the current progress through progress bars.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Advanced level:
\begin{itemize}
	\item No disturbing information boxes about basic tasks.
	\item Increased responsibility as a project manager, clearly visible as specialization-badge for the user.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The user journey is implemented as part of \ac{UC}11 Progress Indicator (\ref{sec:domainBbl}).

\paragraph*{Social Feedback/Feedback loops}

The core engagement loop is built onto the theory behind human motivation, behavioral psychology and behavioral economics. It tries to build a positive and motivating user experience centering the user/player. This is done by the four steps introduced in \ref{fig:engagementLoop}: Motivate Emotion -> Call to Action -> Re-Engage -> Feedback Reward. 

By building use cases implementing these four steps the user's motivation for doing specific tasks can be increased. Some parts of the application using the core engagement loop are listed in the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Risk discussion process (\ref{sec:domainBbg}): Risks traverse a review and discussion process before they are added as final risks. This process is built onto social feedback and interaction between the project members.
	\item Risk adjustment process (\ref{sec:domainBbe}): After adding risks they are classified by the team based on their threat probability.
	\item Progress indicators (\ref{sec:domainBbl}): The application clearly makes the current state and progress visible to the user. Based on specialization-badges it is clearly visible if a user is a beginner, medium or advanced. Based on this state an individual level of support is provided by the application. E.g. if you are new to the application the risk discussion process is in need of explanation, whereas for an advanced user the process is completely clear.
	\item Risk pool (\ref{sec:domainBbf}): The voting process for risks and risks responses to push it into the global risk pool makes use of the core engagement loop combined with social feedback.
\end{itemize}

Social feedback and feedback loops are implemented as part of \ac{UC}4 Risk Adjustment (\ref{sec:domainBbe}), \ac{UC}5 Risk Pool (\ref{sec:domainBbf}), \ac{UC}6 Risk Discussion (\ref{sec:domainBbg}), \ac{UC}7 Risk Monitoring (\ref{sec:domainBbh}), \ac{UC}8 Risk Response Management (\ref{sec:domainBbi}), \ac{UC}9 Project initialization (\ref{sec:domainBbj}), \ac{UC}10 Activity Stream (\ref{sec:domainBbk}) and \ac{UC}11 Progress Indicator (\ref{sec:domainBbl}).

\paragraph*{Task Queue}

Task Queues provide tasks which can be done next. In best case this supports the flow experience (described in \ref{flow}).
They are implemented in the following parts of the application:
\begin{itemize}
	\item After proposing a risk: propose another risk, review a risk
	\item After adding a risk to the risk pool: add another pool risk, add risk response
	\item The whole process of initializing a project is guided and uses task queues
	\item After monitoring one risk: monitor another risk (if you are the person in charge)
	\item After setting a challenge: propose a challenge to a colleague
\end{itemize}

Task Queues are an Information Pattern and implemented as part of \ac{UC}5 Risk Pool (\ref{sec:domainBbf}), \ac{UC}6 Risk Discussion (\ref{sec:domainBbg}), \ac{UC}7 Risk Monitoring (\ref{sec:domainBbh}), \ac{UC}8 Risk Response Management (\ref{sec:domainBbi}), \ac{UC}9 Project initialization (\ref{sec:domainBbj}), \ac{UC}10 Activity Stream (\ref{sec:domainBbk}) and \ac{UC}11 Progress Indicator (\ref{sec:domainBbl}).

\paragraph*{Additional minor patterns}
Further minor patterns play an underlying role or can be used as further expansions of the application:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Broadcast (e.g. Risks are shared between users)
	\item Predictable Results
	\item State Preservation
	\item Organization of Information
	\item Personalization (e.g. Risk Pool with Recommendation engine)
	\item Reporting (e.g. risks can be reported)
	\item Search (e.g. Risk Pool is searchable)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Evaluation}
\label{sec:domainCd}

\spacing{1.5}

For evaluating the acceptance of the gamified application for project risk management we have chosen a qualitative approach. After finishing the conception, a clickable prototype was created. Based on this prototype we have evaluated the reaction of real potential users through user interviews. The gained feedback and a detailed description and analysis of the user interviews can be found in \ref{sec:DomainAb}.
The whole feedback was considered in the later development of the application. To achieve measurable indicators of the impact of gamification on risk management effords a long term evaluation phase with different project groups would be necessary which is out of scope for this project.
