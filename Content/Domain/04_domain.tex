\section{Gamification}
\label{sec:domainC}

\spacing{1.5}

The Gamification conception is based on the Gamification Design Process described in chapter \ref{sec:theoryBd}. Therefore the following chapters deal with the Player (chapter \ref{sec:domainCa}), the Mission (chapter \ref{sec:domainCb}), Mechanics (chapter \ref{sec:domainCc}) and the evaluation (chapter \ref{sec:domainCd}).

\subsection{Player Personas}
\label{sec:domainCa}

By the initial survey the application's target group was figured out (chapter \ref{sec:DomainA}). Based on this Player Personas for the following three groups were created.

\begin{itemize}
	\item project manager
	\item product manager
	\item team member
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mission}
\label{sec:domainCb}

By defining the mission we aim to have a specific vision in mind, from which the following steps can be derived. Like described in the theory chapter \ref{sec:theoryBd} the mission is defined. 
First of all the current situation is considered (chapter \ref{sec:theoryA}). As target business outcome we would like to lower the number of projects failing because of not considered risk management. This should be achieved by the development of a gamified application for project risk management.
Our mission is to increase the user engagement and support habit building in terms of project risk management. Especially the by project managers demanded part of risk response management and monitoring (chapter \ref{sec:DomainA}) should support the project managers as best as possible.

\subsection{Mechanics}
\label{sec:domainCc}

This chapter describes the mechanics conception which Motivational Design Patterns from chapter \ref{sec:theoryBc} are used.
Following mechanics are used and described in detail:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Activity Stream and Notifications
	\item Growth, Specialization—Badge and Increased Responsibility
	\item Self defined challenges
	\item Praise and Rewards (Score)
	\item Collaborative form of leaderboards
	\item Journey
	\item Social Feedback/Feedback loops
	\item Task Queue
	\item Further used patterns
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Activity Stream and Notifications}
The activity stream represents the start page and is a key component of the application. Through it the user is notified about relevant changes. Furthermore the sent messages can motivate the user to directly jump into a specific workflow or task. 
It is part of the application wide engagement loop. Especially accountable for the initial motivating emotion and the call to action.
%TODO ??? With notifications appearing 
%Push notifications
%-> abgewandelte form von operant conditioning mit variable ratio

The used patterns are the activity stream as social pattern and notifications as interface pattern.
The activity streams is implemented as part of \ac{UC}10 Activity Stream (\ref{sec:domainBbk}).

\paragraph*{Growth, Specialization—Badge and Increased Responsibility}

Depending on their level of interacting with the application users can be classified on the range between beginner and advanced. This can be mapped by following five Specialization—Badges:

project manager > risk buster > risk sage > risk owner > project member

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Project member: basic project member without any specific rights
	\item Risk owner: reached by owning TODO: XYZ risks (being the person in charge).
	\item Risk sage: reached by reviewing and contributing TODO: XYZ risks.
	\item Risk buster: reached by successfully contributing TODO: XYZ risk responses.
	\item Project manager: highest achievable badge with right for creating new projects and managing existing projects.
\end{enumerate}

Growth is achieved in two areas. On the one hand Specialization—Badges and on the other hand the further development of project risks.

Increased responsibility is used for the process of creating and managing a project. There are two workflows how a project can be initialized. The first possibility is that a user who has reached the project manager Specialization—Badge creates the project. The second possibility is that at least two members insure, that one person can be a project manager.

All three patterns (Growth, Specialization—Badge, Increased Responsibility) belong to the group of gameful patterns.
They are implemented as part of \ac{UC}1 User CRUD (\ref{sec:domainBbb}), \ac{UC}2 Team Access CRUD (\ref{sec:domainBbc}), \ac{UC}6 Risk Discussion (\ref{sec:domainBbg}), \ac{UC}8 Risk Response Management (\ref{sec:domainBbi}), \ac{UC}11 Progress Indicator (\ref{sec:domainBbl}).

\paragraph*{Self defined challenges}

Applied challenges have a positive impact while doing and after completing. While doing the user is motivated to complete the challenge. By completing challenges the users are feeling competent and their self-efficacy is increasing. A possible risk could be challenges that are too difficult and therefore demotivating. That is why we use the concept of self defined challenges. By setting the challenges by their own the probability of success is increased.

Self defined challenges appear at several locations in the risk management application:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Project initialization (e.g. project manager defines how many risks should be contributed in a self defined time period)
	\item Risk Monitoring (e.g. daily, weekly or monthly question if preventive action was done with reminder as notification before that)
\end{itemize}

The challenges mechanic is part of the gameful patterns. 
Self defined challenges are implemented as part of \ac{UC}7 Risk Monitoring (\ref{sec:domainBbh}) and \ac{UC}9 Project initialization (\ref{sec:domainBbj}).

\paragraph*{Praise and Rewards (Score)}

\paragraph*{Collaborative form of leaderboards}

\paragraph*{Journey}

\paragraph*{Social Feedback/Feedback loops}

u.a. Risk discussion (review process)

\paragraph*{Task Queue}

Flow

\paragraph*{Further used patterns}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Broadcast (e.g. Risks are shared between users)
	\item Predictable Results
	\item State Preservation
	\item Organization of Information
	\item Personalization (e.g. Risk Pool with Recommendation engine)
	\item Reporting (e.g. risks can be reported)
	\item Search (e.g. Risk Pool is searchable)
\end{itemize}
