\chapter{Implementation}
\label{ch:implementation}

This chapter will give an insight into what has been implemented and is functional yet. Due to the overall available time, the authors of this thesis focused on building a \ac{MVP}. In general, an \acs{MVP} is useful approach to learn about the users needs by only providing what is needed to run the application with its basic features \cite{keshlafModelPrototypeTool2000}

Furthermore, this chapter does not describe the software's architecture. One can refer to chapter \ref{sec:DomainC} for more information about the architecture and requirements.
