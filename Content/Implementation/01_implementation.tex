\label{sec:implementationInfra}

The implementation of the use cases Project Access Management (\ref{sec:domainBbc}) and User CRUD (\ref{sec:domainBbb}) is finished. According to the use cases, one can create an account and then be invited to projects or open one themselves. Both use cases had to be implemented beforehand as risks should be related to a project which again are composed of multiple users (\ref{sec:domainBbc}, \ref{sec:domainBbb}).

In figure TODO XXX one can see the profile page of a user which is available after logging in. Additionally, one part of the gamification elements is visible: user achievements which can be acquired by different actions such as being responsible for a project risk.

TODO: Screenshot of profile page

Figure TODO XXX shows the creation dialog of a project. After entering the needed information and submitting by clicking “Save”, the project is created and will be available for all its member. These information can be edited later, as well as the information for the user / own account which can be edited in separate view. Within a project, a member can create and discuss project risks (\ref{sec:implementationRisks}).
