Risk Management is regarded as an essential part of project management. However, it is often neglected by professionals. Even if risks are considered in the beginning of projects, less attention is payed to it during project lifetime, especially in stressful situations. 
We propose to solve this challenge by gamifying risk management. 
The main contributions of our paper are:
identifying the requirements of project managers regarding a risk management tool by a survey, 
the design of a gamified application and its prototypical implementation, as well as the qualitative evaluation of the effectiveness of our approach.
