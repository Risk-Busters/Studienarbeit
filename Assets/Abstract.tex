Risk Management is regarded as an essential part of project management. However, it is often neglected by professionals. Even if risks are considered in the beginning of projects, less attention is payed to them during project lifetime, especially in stressful situations. 
We propose to solve this challenge by gamifying risk management. 
The main contributions of our paper are:
identifying the requirements of project managers regarding a risk management tool by a survey, the design of a gamified application resulting in a mock-up prototype, the qualitative evaluation of the effectiveness of our approach based on the mock-up prototype, as well as a prototypical implementation. 
The main results of our work are:
Survey results showed that it is necessary to re-engage project members throughout the project lifetime to consider risk management. Therefore we designed our application for supporting the whole lifecycle of projects and the associated risk management. The qualitative evaluation has shown, that the project managers would like to have an integrated process for risk management, supported by a tool, instead of risk management as a one-time activity. Based on the findings, the prototypical implementation focuses on the whole process of handling risks through their lifetime.
